## Welcome to Van-Thuy Phi's Page

News: I have moved to RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (RIKEN AIP, Nihonbashi, Tokyo) as a Postdoctoral Researcher.

I am also involved with National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS, Tsukuba, Ibaraki) as a visiting researcher.

Please check my [researchmap](https://researchmap.jp/pvt?lang=en).


Previously, I received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Information Science from  Nara Institute of Science and Technology ([NAIST](http://www.naist.jp/en/)) under the supervision of Prof. [Yuji Matsumoto](https://cl.naist.jp/staff/matsu/home-e.html), in 2016 and 2019, respectively.

From 2019-2022, I was a postdoctoral fellow with the Nara Institute of Science and Technology ([Prof. Taro Watanabe's Natural Language Processing Lab.](https://nlp.naist.jp/en/), NAIST). I conducted my postdoctoral research in the research group of Assoc. Prof. [Hiroyuki Shindo](https://hshindo.com), where I mainly focused on extracting data from chart images using ML-based computer vision techniques.


Research Interests:
- Deep Learning & NLP (Information Extraction: Relation Extraction, NER; Recommender Systems, etc.)
- Computer Vision (Object Detection + Semantic/Instance/Panoptic Segmentation, etc.)
